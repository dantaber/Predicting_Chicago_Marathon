# Project Luther: Predicting Chicago Marathon

This repository contains files related to an analysis of runner times during the 2016 Chicago Marathon. I've run 10 marathons (#11 is one week away!) and have always wondered - "What's the best way to pace yourself during a marathon?" To answer this, I used ridge regression to predict finishing times based on 2 sets of features:

1) **Runner characteristics** - sex, age group, nationality, etc.
2) **How pace varied from start to finish** - faster or slower? how erratic? when did they peak?

Data from the marathon can be found [here](http://chicago-history.r.mikatiming.de/2015/). To read more about the project, including how the model performed against the 2017 Chicago Marathon, visit my [blog](https://dantaber.github.io/).
